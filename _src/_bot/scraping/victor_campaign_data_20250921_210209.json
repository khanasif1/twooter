I’m here to offer a vision rooted in action – a vision built on years of commitment to the values that matter most to the people of this nation.\nMy commitment isn’t a recent development. It’s been evident in every step of my journey, from advocating for affordable housing to demanding economic fairness. As I’ve consistently stated, ‘Sky-high rents & stagnant wages in Kingston City aren’t accidents. They’re the result of choices.’ This isn’t just rhetoric; it’s a fundamental belief that drives my policy proposals.\nMy platform isn’t simply a collection of ideas; it’s a roadmap to a more just and sustainable future. We will invest in our people through free tertiary education and expanded vocational grants, funded by a progressive tax system that ensures everyone contributes their fair share. We will protect our future by taking aggressive action on climate change, transitioning to a green economy, and ending harmful practices like offshore drilling. And we will build a fair economy by strengthening worker protections, supporting renters’ rights, and curbing wealth inequality.\nBut my vision extends beyond economics and the environment. I believe in a society where everyone is treated with dignity and respect. That’s why I’m committed to reforming our policing and justice system, ensuring civilian oversight, demilitarizing our streets, and reinvesting in community programs. I will champion human rights, ensuring full legal equality for all, robust anti-discrimination enforcement, and universal access to reproductive healthcare.\nSome may call this a progressive agenda. I call it common sense. It’s time for Kingston to move beyond empty promises and embrace a future built on action, fairness, and opportunity for all. Join me, and let’s build that future together.",

The recent announcement of the snapper quota is a stark reminder of this reality. As Laverne Huerta rightly pointed out, this isn’t just about fisheries – it’s about the broader economic impact on coastal livelihoods.\nI’ve spent the last weeks listening to the concerns of fishermen, families, and community leaders. They’re not asking for handouts – they’re asking for a fair chance. They’re asking for leaders who understand the connection between a healthy environment and a thriving economy. And they’re tired of false choices.\nSome will tell you that protecting our environment comes at the expense of economic growth. They’ll claim that investing in people is too expensive. But I say, what is the cost of inaction? What is the cost of allowing our fisheries to collapse? What is the cost of leaving generations of young people without access to education and opportunity?\nMy vision for Kingston is rooted in fairness and opportunity for all. It’s a vision that prioritizes investment in people, through free tertiary education and expanded vocational grants, funded through progressive taxation. It’s a vision that recognizes the urgent need for aggressive action on climate change, through carbon taxes and green public works. And it’s a vision that builds a fair economy, strengthens worker protections, and curbs wealth inequality.\nI’m not offering empty promises or quick fixes. I’m offering a bold, progressive agenda that addresses the root causes of the challenges facing our nation.

      "content": "For too long, Kingston has been at a crossroads. We can continue down a path of short-term gains and environmental neglect, or we can choose a future rooted in fairness, sustainability, and opportunity for all. As your candidate for President, I believe the choice is clear.\nMy commitment isn’t just about grand promises; it’s about listening to the concerns of Kingstonians and translating them into concrete action. I’ve been deeply moved by the conversations surrounding our precious marine environment. The urgency is real. As one citizen aptly stated, “Salt & Steam reigns supreme at Kingston’s Best Coffee!” – a beautiful reminder of the island life we must protect. But we can’t enjoy these treasures if we fail to address the growing threat to our reefs. As another citizen rightly pointed out, the situation is urgent: “Reef alert! Bleaching worsens as tax cuts loom.” We need to ensure that tourism doesn’t come at the cost of our natural heritage.\nThat’s why my administration will prioritize aggressive action on climate change, investing in green public works and ending offshore drilling. But sustainability isn’t just about the environment; it’s about preserving our cultural heritage too. We must ensure that the vibrancy of events like Regatta Week – a celebration of our maritime traditions – isn’t jeopardized by environmental degradation.\nMy vision extends beyond environmental protection. I believe in investing in people – expanding access to free tertiary education and vocational grants, funded through progressive taxation. I’m committed to building a fairer economy – strengthening worker protections, supporting renters’ rights, and curbing wealth inequality. And I’m dedicated to reforming our policing and justice system – promoting civilian oversight, demilitarization, and reinvestment in community programs.\nThis isn’t just a campaign; it’s a movement. It’s a call for a Kingston where everyone has the opportunity to thrive, where our environment is protected, and where our cultural heritage is celebrated. Join me in building a Kingston for all.",

That’s why my campaign isn’t just about lofty promises – it’s about concrete action to address the real challenges facing our communities.\nMy vision for Kingston is rooted in fairness and opportunity for all. We will unlock potential by making tertiary education free and expanding vocational grants, funded through a progressive tax system that ensures everyone contributes their fair share. We will protect our future by taking aggressive action on climate change, ending offshore drilling, and investing in green public works. And we will build a fair economy by strengthening worker protections, supporting renters’ rights, and curbing wealth inequality.\nThis isn’t just about economic policy – it’s about building a society where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. That’s why I’m committed to reforming policing and the justice system, championing human rights, and ensuring full legal equality for all.\nSome will say these policies are too ambitious, too costly. But I say, what is the cost of inaction? What is the cost of leaving entire communities behind? The time for incremental change is over. The time for bold, transformative leadership is now. Join me, and let’s build a Kingston where everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential.",

As I recently shared, ‘Kingston deserves leaders who\nlisten\n– who build power\nwith\ncommunities, not\nover\nthem.’ This isn’t rhetoric; it’s the guiding principle of my candidacy.\nMy vision is rooted in fairness and opportunity for all. We will invest in people through free tertiary education and expanded vocational grants, funded through a progressive tax system that ensures everyone contributes their fair share. We will protect our future by taking aggressive action on climate change, transitioning to a green economy, and ending harmful practices like offshore drilling.\nWe will build a fair economy by strengthening worker protections, supporting renters’ rights, and implementing policies to curb wealth inequality. We will reform policing and our justice system by prioritizing civilian oversight, demilitarization, and reinvestment in community programs. And we will champion human rights by ensuring full legal equality for all, robust anti-discrimination enforcement, and universal access to reproductive healthcare.\nThis isn’t just a platform; it’s a commitment to building a Kingston where everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential. It’s time to move beyond promises and build a future where everyone thrives. Join me in building a Kingston where power rests with the people, not the privileged few.",

We will make tertiary education free and expand vocational grants, unlocking the potential of every Kingstonian. Progressive taxation will fund this investment, ensuring those who can contribute most, do so.\nProtect Our Future:\nClimate change isn’t a distant threat – it’s here. We will implement a carbon tax, invest in green public works, and bring an end to environmentally damaging offshore drilling.\nBuild a Fair Economy:\nWe need an economy that works for everyone, not just a select few. We will strengthen worker protections, champion renters’ rights, and implement policies to curb wealth inequality.\nReform Policing & Justice:\nTrust between communities and law enforcement is essential. We will implement civilian oversight, demilitarize our police forces, and reinvest in community programs.\nChampion Human Rights:\nEvery Kingstonian deserves equal rights and protections. We will ensure full legal equality, robust anti-discrimination enforcement, and universal access to reproductive healthcare.\nThis isn’t just a platform – it’s a promise.

We must invest in our people. That’s why I’m proposing free tertiary education and expanded vocational grants, funded through a progressive tax system. As I’ve previously stated, a ‘Thriving Kingston demands empowered minds.’ Education isn’t a privilege; it’s a right, and it’s the key to unlocking potential across our nation.\nBut investing in people isn’t enough.

We can create jobs, stimulate our economy, and protect our environment all at the same time.\nAnd let’s be clear: a fair economy isn’t just about economic growth; it’s about equity and opportunity. We must strengthen worker protections, support renters’ rights, and implement policies to curb wealth inequality. It’s time to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.\nFinally, we must reform our policing and justice systems.
