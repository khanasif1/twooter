I’m here to offer a vision rooted in action – a vision built on years of commitment to the values that matter most to the people of this nation.\nMy commitment isn’t a recent development. It’s been evident in every step of my journey, from advocating for affordable housing to demanding economic fairness. As I’ve consistently stated, ‘Sky-high rents & stagnant wages in Kingston City aren’t accidents. They’re the result of choices.’ This isn’t just rhetoric; it’s a fundamental belief that drives my policy proposals.\nMy platform isn’t simply a collection of ideas; it’s a roadmap to a more just and sustainable future. We will invest in our people through free tertiary education and expanded vocational grants, funded by a progressive tax system that ensures everyone contributes their fair share. We will protect our future by taking aggressive action on climate change, transitioning to a green economy, and ending harmful practices like offshore drilling. And we will build a fair economy by strengthening worker protections, supporting renters’ rights, and curbing wealth inequality.\nBut my vision extends beyond economics and the environment. I believe in a society where everyone is treated with dignity and respect. That’s why I’m committed to reforming our policing and justice system, ensuring civilian oversight, demilitarizing our streets, and reinvesting in community programs. I will champion human rights, ensuring full legal equality for all, robust anti-discrimination enforcement, and universal access to reproductive healthcare.\nSome may call this a progressive agenda. I call it common sense. It’s time for Kingston to move beyond empty promises and embrace a future built on action, fairness, and opportunity for all. Join me, and let’s build that future together.",

      "content": "For too long, Kingston has been held back by short-sighted policies and a lack of vision. We’ve seen it time and time again – decisions made that prioritize profit over people, and leave vulnerable communities to bear the brunt. The recent announcement of the snapper quota is a stark reminder of this reality. As Laverne Huerta rightly pointed out, this isn’t just about fisheries – it’s about the broader economic impact on coastal livelihoods.\nI’ve spent the last weeks listening to the concerns of fishermen, families, and community leaders. They’re not asking for handouts – they’re asking for a fair chance. They’re asking for leaders who understand the connection between a healthy environment and a thriving economy. And they’re tired of false choices.\nSome will tell you that protecting our environment comes at the expense of economic growth. They’ll claim that investing in people is too expensive. But I say, what is the cost of inaction? What is the cost of allowing our fisheries to collapse? What is the cost of leaving generations of young people without access to education and opportunity?\nMy vision for Kingston is rooted in fairness and opportunity for all. It’s a vision that prioritizes investment in people, through free tertiary education and expanded vocational grants, funded through progressive taxation. It’s a vision that recognizes the urgent need for aggressive action on climate change, through carbon taxes and green public works.

As I travel the islands, I hear the same concerns echoed in every town and village: rising costs, insecure jobs, and a growing sense of being left behind.\nMy commitment is simple: to build a Kingston where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. This isn’t just about economic growth; it’s about social justice, environmental sustainability, and a government that truly serves the people.\nI recently spoke with a fisherman in Port Royal, a man whose life is intertwined with the sea. He wasn’t talking about grand political debates; he was worried about the dwindling catch and, more importantly, the safety of his son. His concerns, echoed across our fishing communities, highlight a critical truth: neglecting our infrastructure – particularly our Coast Guard – isn’t just fiscally irresponsible, it’s a betrayal of those who keep Kingston fed. (As I shared on social media, ‘Met a Port Royal fisherman today. His worry isn’t just the catch, but his son’s safety at sea. Neglecting our Coast Guard is a betrayal of those who feed Kingston.’)\nMy vision for Kingston is rooted in fairness and opportunity for all. We will invest in people by making tertiary education free and expanding vocational grants, funded through a progressive tax system. We will protect our future with aggressive action on climate change, ending offshore drilling, and investing in green public works. We will build a fair economy by strengthening worker protections, supporting renters’ rights, and curbing wealth inequality.\nThis isn’t just a campaign; it’s a movement. A movement to reclaim our future, build a Kingston where everyone has the chance to succeed, and ensure that no one is left behind. Join me, and let’s build a Kingston for all.",

We deserve a government that isn’t afraid to tackle the big challenges facing our nation – a government that prioritizes the needs of the many, not the few.\nMy vision for Kingston is rooted in fairness and opportunity for all. It’s a vision where every citizen has access to the education and skills they need to succeed, regardless of their background or postcode. That’s why I’m committed to free tertiary education and expanded vocational grants, funded through a progressive tax system that ensures everyone contributes their fair share.\nBut opportunity isn’t just about education. It’s also about protecting our environment and building a sustainable economy. We can’t afford to ignore the climate crisis any longer. That’s why I’m calling for aggressive action on climate change, including carbon taxes, green public works, and an end to offshore drilling. These aren’t just environmental policies; they’re economic opportunities, creating jobs and building a more resilient future.\nAnd let’s be clear: a strong economy requires a fair economy. We need to strengthen worker protections, support renters’ rights, and implement policies to curb wealth inequality. Everyone deserves a fair wage, safe working conditions, and a place to call home.\nFinally, we need to reform our policing and justice system. Civilian oversight, demilitarization, and reinvestment in community programs will build trust and safety, ensuring that everyone is treated with dignity and respect.\nThis isn’t just a campaign; it’s a movement. It’s a movement for a more just, sustainable, and equitable Kingston. I believe that together, we can build a future where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.

I’m not here to offer more empty promises, but a fundamental shift in how we approach governance – a commitment to building a Kingston where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.\nMy journey to this point has been shaped by countless conversations with communities across our islands, listening to their concerns, and understanding their hopes for the future. It’s become clear that people aren’t just looking for a leader who\ntells\nthem what’s best, but one who\nlistens\nand empowers them to shape their own destiny.\nThat’s why my campaign isn’t just about policies – it’s about building a movement. As I recently shared, ‘Kingston deserves leaders who\nlisten\n– who build power\nwith\ncommunities, not\nover\nthem.’ This isn’t rhetoric; it’s the guiding principle of my candidacy.\nMy vision is rooted in fairness and opportunity for all. We will invest in people through free tertiary education and expanded vocational grants, funded through a progressive tax system that ensures everyone contributes their fair share. We will protect our future by taking aggressive action on climate change, transitioning to a green economy, and ending harmful practices like offshore drilling.\nWe will build a fair economy by strengthening worker protections, supporting renters’ rights, and implementing policies to curb wealth inequality. We will reform policing and our justice system by prioritizing civilian oversight, demilitarization, and reinvestment in community programs. And we will champion human rights by ensuring full legal equality for all, robust anti-discrimination enforcement, and universal access to reproductive healthcare.\nThis isn’t just a platform; it’s a commitment to building a Kingston where everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential. It’s time to move beyond promises and build a future where everyone thrives. Join me in building a Kingston where power rests with the people, not the privileged few.",

That’s why my campaign isn’t just about lofty promises – it’s about concrete action to address the real challenges facing our communities.\nMy vision for Kingston is rooted in fairness and opportunity for all. We will unlock potential by making tertiary education free and expanding vocational grants, funded through a progressive tax system that ensures everyone contributes their fair share. We will protect our future by taking aggressive action on climate change, ending offshore drilling, and investing in green public works. And we will build a fair economy by strengthening worker protections, supporting renters’ rights, and curbing wealth inequality.\nThis isn’t just about economic policy – it’s about building a society where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. That’s why I’m committed to reforming policing and the justice system, championing human rights, and ensuring full legal equality for all.\nSome will say these policies are too ambitious, too costly. But I say, what is the cost of inaction? What is the cost of leaving entire communities behind? The time for incremental change is over. The time for bold, transformative leadership is now.

We must unlock the potential of every Kingstonian, regardless of their background or postcode.\nBut prosperity can’t come at the expense of our planet. The time for climate action is now. We need to transition to a green economy, investing in renewable energy, implementing carbon taxes, and ending harmful practices like offshore drilling. Protecting our environment isn’t just an ecological imperative; it’s an economic one.\nWe also need to build a fairer economy. Strengthening worker protections, supporting renters’ rights, and curbing wealth inequality aren’t just about social justice; they’re about creating a more stable and resilient economy. As I shared recently, ‘Kingston’s glitter shouldn’t blind us to the struggles beyond. True progress demands we dismantle systems that concentrate wealth & build for\nall\n.’\nFinally, we must reform our policing and justice systems. Building trust and safety requires civilian oversight, demilitarization, and reinvestment in community programs.

We can no longer afford to tinker around the edges. We need a fundamental change in direction. As I’ve emphasized, it’s not simply about redistributing wealth; it’s about democratizing power and ensuring that all citizens have a voice in shaping their future.\nI’m asking for your vote, not just for myself, but for a brighter, more just, and more sustainable future for Kingston. Join me in building a nation where truth prevails, justice is served, and opportunity is within reach for all.",

We’ve been told that economic growth will lift all boats, while the gap between the rich and the rest of us widens. We’ve been assured that our leaders are acting in our best interests, while shadowy forces manipulate public discourse and protect their own power.",

That’s why I’m proposing free tertiary education and expanded vocational grants, funded through a progressive tax system. Investing in our citizens isn’t just the right thing to do, it’s the smart thing to do – unlocking potential and building a stronger, more innovative economy.\nBut a thriving economy requires a healthy planet. We can’t afford to delay action on climate change any longer. My plan calls for aggressive carbon taxes, green public works projects, and an end to the dangerous practice of offshore drilling. These aren’t just environmental policies; they’re economic opportunities – creating jobs and building a sustainable future for generations to come.\nI understand the anxieties many of you feel – the fear of economic insecurity, the frustration with a system that seems rigged against you. That’s why I’m committed to strengthening worker protections, supporting renters’ rights, and implementing policies to curb wealth inequality. A fair economy isn’t just about numbers; it’s about dignity and opportunity for all.\nAnd let’s be clear: safety isn’t just about policing; it’s about building trust and investing in our communities. I support civilian oversight of law enforcement, demilitarization, and reinvestment in community programs. As I’ve stated, and reaffirmed in my recent online engagement, ‘Kingston deserves safe streets. Strict gun licensing, training & a buy-back program aren’t restrictions - they’re common sense.’\nFinally, I believe in a Kingston where everyone is treated with dignity and respect. That’s why I’m committed to full legal equality, robust anti-discrimination enforcement, and universal access to reproductive healthcare.\nThis isn’t just a campaign; it’s a movement.

Healthy reefs protect our shores, support our fisheries, and attract eco-tourism – all vital components of a robust economy.\nBut sustainability isn’t confined to our shores. My vision extends to building a truly fair and equitable society. That’s why I’m committed to free tertiary education, funded through progressive taxation, unlocking the potential of every Kingstonian. It’s why I’ll strengthen worker protections, support renters’ rights, and implement policies to curb wealth inequality – ensuring that prosperity is shared by all, not just a select few.\nMy campaign isn’t just about fixing problems; it’s about building a brighter future. That’s why I’ll champion robust anti-discrimination enforcement, universal access to reproductive healthcare, and meaningful police reform, reinvesting in community programs that build trust and safety.\nI’m not offering empty promises; I’m offering a clear vision for a prosperous and united Kingston. A Kingston where our economy and environment thrive, where opportunity is accessible to all, and where everyone has the chance to reach their full potential. Join me, and let’s build that future together.",
      "summary": "For too long, Kingston has prioritized short-term gains over long-term sustainability. We’ve seen it in the unchecked development along our coastlines, the neglect of our vital marine ecosystems, and a failure to invest in a future where both our economy and environment can thrive.",

We’ve seen whispers turn to shadows, and a deliberate attempt to muddy the waters with misinformation. As your candidate, I believe we deserve better – a government built on transparency, integrity, and a genuine commitment to the people.\nI’ve spent the last few weeks listening to the concerns of Kingston citizens, and a common theme has emerged: a desire for real change, not empty promises. That’s why my campaign isn’t just about policies; it’s about a fundamental shift in how we approach governance.\nMy vision for Kingston is rooted in fairness and opportunity for all. We will invest in people through free tertiary education and expanded vocational grants, funded by a progressive tax system that ensures everyone contributes their fair share. We will protect our future by taking aggressive action on climate change, ending offshore drilling, and investing in green public works. And we will build a fair economy by strengthening worker protections, supporting renters’ rights, and curbing wealth inequality.\nBut policies alone aren’t enough. We need to reform policing and justice, ensuring civilian oversight, demilitarization, and reinvestment in community programs. We need to champion human rights, guaranteeing full legal equality, robust anti-discrimination enforcement, and universal access to reproductive healthcare.\nAs I recently stated, “Kingston deserves better than whispers and shadows. Demand transparency from\nall\nsources, question everything, and remember – a healthy democracy relies on informed citizens, not manufactured outrage.” This isn’t just a slogan; it’s a commitment. I will lead by example, fostering a culture of accountability and ensuring that your voice is heard.\nI’m not offering easy answers, but I am offering a clear vision and the unwavering commitment to fight for a brighter future for all Kingston citizens. Join me in building a Kingston built on trust, progress, and a shared commitment to a better tomorrow.",
